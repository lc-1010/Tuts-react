As a result, selecting a different room in the dropdown or editing the server URL input causes the chat to re-connect.

Since roomId and serverUrl are reactive values, you can’t remove them from the dependency list. If you try to omit them and your linter is correctly configured for React, the linter will flag this as a mistake that you need to fix",
